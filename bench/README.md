# NoProto Benchmarks

The benchmarks in this folder are used to record performance progress and provide entirely subjective comparisons to other similar projects.

All libraries are working with an object that contains the same data and fields.  Data types are matched as much as possible.

### Size Benchmark
The example object is encoded once, and it's size in bytes is recorded as well as it's size in bytes with zlib compression.

### Encode Benchmark
The example object is encoded/serialized into the format supported by the various libraries.  Specifically, the benchmark measures how long it takes to get an owned `Vec<u8>` out of the library.

### Decode Benchmark
A single object is encoded, then the library decodes that object into it's parts 1,000,000 times.  Copying of the original buffer is only perfomed if it's needed by the library to complete decoding.  This measures how long it takes to get a shared immutable reference to all values in the object.

### Update Benchmark
A single object is encoded, then the library should decode, update then re encode the object 1,000,000 times.  The benchmark measures how long it takes to get from a deserialized buffer into another deserialized buffer with a single update performed in the new buffer.

Benchmarks can be ran with `cargo run --release`.
