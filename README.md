NoProto allows you to store, read & mutate structured data with very little overhead. It's like Protocol Buffers except schemas are dynamic at runtime and buffers are mutable.  It's like JSON but way faster, type safe and supports native types.  Also unlike Protocol Buffers you can insert values in any order and values can later be removed or updated without rebuilding the whole buffer.

Like Protocol Buffers schemas are seperate from the data buffers and are required to read, create or update data buffers.

Byte-wise sorting comes in the box and is a first class operation. Two NoProto buffers can be compared at the byte level *without deserializing* and a correct ordering between the buffer's internal values will be the result.  This is extremely useful for storing ordered keys in databases. 

*Compared to Protocol Buffers*
- Similar serialization & deserialization performance
- Updating buffers is orders of magnitude faster
- Easier & Simpler API
- Schemas are dynamic at runtime, no compilation step
- Supports more types and better nested type support
- Byte-wise sorting is first class operation
- Mutate (add/delete/update) existing/imported buffers

*Compared to JSON / BSON*
- Far more space efficient
- Significantly faster serialization & deserialization
- Deserializtion is zero copy
- Has schemas / type safe
- Supports byte-wise sorting
- Supports raw bytes & other native types

# Quick Example
```rust
use no_proto::error::NP_Error;
use no_proto::NP_Factory;
use no_proto::collection::table::NP_Table;

// JSON is used to describe schema for the factory
// Each factory represents a single schema
// One factory can be used to serialize/deserialize any number of buffers
let user_factory = NP_Factory::new(r#"{
    "type": "table",
    "columns": [
        ["name",   {"type": "string"}],
        ["age",    {"type": "u16", "default": 0}],
        ["tags",   {"type": "list", "of": {
            "type": "string"
        }}]
    ]
}"#)?;


// create a new empty buffer
let mut user_buffer = user_factory.empty_buffer(None); // optional capacity, optional address size (u16 by default)

// set an internal value of the buffer, set the  "name" column
user_buffer.set(&["name"], "Billy Joel")?;

// assign nested internal values, sets the first tag element
user_buffer.set(&["tags", "0"], "first tag")?;

// get an internal value of the buffer from the "name" column
let name = user_buffer.get::<&str>(&["name"])?;
assert_eq!(name, Some("Billy Joel"));

// close buffer and get internal bytes
let user_bytes: Vec<u8> = user_buffer.close();

// open the buffer again
let user_buffer = user_factory.open_buffer(user_bytes);

// get nested internal value, first tag from the tag list
let tag = user_buffer.get::<&str>(&["tags", "0"])?;
assert_eq!(tag, Some("first tag"));

// get nested internal value, the age field
let age = user_buffer.get::<u16>(&["age"])?;
// returns default value from schema
assert_eq!(age, Some(0u16));

// close again
let user_bytes: Vec<u8> = user_buffer.close();


// we can now save user_bytes to disk, 
// send it over the network, or whatever else is needed with the data


# Ok::<(), NP_Error>(()) 
```

## Benchmarks
While it's difficult to properly benchmark libraries like these in a fair way, I've made an attempt in the graph below.  These benchmarks are available in the `bench` folder and you can easily run them yourself with `cargo run --release`. 

The format and data used in the benchmarks were taken from the `flatbuffers` benchmarks github repo.  You should always benchmark/test your own use case for each library before making any decisions on what to use.

- **Encode**: Transfer a collection of test data into a serialized `Vec<u8>`.
- **Decode All**: Deserialize the test object from the `Vec<u8>` into all it's properties.
- **Decode 1**: Deserialize the test object from the `Vec<u8>` into one of it's properties.
- **Update 1**: Deserialize, update a single property, then serialize back into `Vec<u8>`.

Complete benchmark source code is available [here](https://github.com/only-cliches/NoProto/tree/master/bench).

In my opinion the benchmarks above make NoProto the clear winner if you ever plan to mutate or update your buffer data.  If buffer data can always be immutable and the fixed compiled schemas aren't an issue, Flatbuffers is the better choice.

I also think there's a strong argument here against using data without a schema.  The cost of an entirely flexible formats like JSON or BSON is crazy.  Putting schemas on your data not only increases your data hygiene but makes the storage of the data far more comapct while increasing the deserialization and serialization perfomrance substantially.

#### Limitations
- Buffers cannot be larger than 2^16 bytes (~16kb).
- Collections (Lists, Maps, Tuples & Tables) cannot have more than 255 immediate child items.
- Enum/Option types are limited to 255 choices and choice strings cannot be larger than 255 bytes.
- Tables are limited to 255 columns and column names cannot be larger than 255 bytes.
- Buffers are not validated or checked before deserializing.

#### Non Goals / Known Tradeoffs 
If every CPU cycle counts, you don't mind compiling fixed schemas and you don't plan to mutate your buffers/objects, FlatBuffers/CapnProto is probably the way to go.  It's impossible to make a flexible format like NoProto as fast as formats that compile your schemas ahead of time and store data immutably.
